Compiling Notes for FAB@Home

ONLY USE Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (full version) to compile
	-DO NOT USE VISUAL EXPRESS EDITION
	-Program requires MFC 8.0, which comes with visual studio 2008

Once Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 is installed open the FabAtHome.vcproj file
contained in the same folder as this note.  Simply double clicking on it should
properly open the project.

ONLY USE THE FabAtHome.dsw if you want to open the program in the old Visual Studio
(VC++ 6), otherwise ALWAYS USE the FabAtHome.vcproj file in order to keep the project
space consistent with the 2008 standards.

For future versions of Visual Studio one should open the 2008 file then recompile to create
a new project file in the latest format and then update these notes.



Problems Solved:

	Forced a complete project rebuild because there is compatability issues with 
	previous compiled headers.


Some general notes:

	The tool type of any given layer is stored in its respective chunk, not in the layer itself,
	use a method like chunk[FindChunk(fab.layer[c].chunkid)] to get the chunk of a layer
